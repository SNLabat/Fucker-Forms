v1.2 Changelog
1) Lil Fucker is now live! I trained a chatbot on the SASP SOPs and procedures as well as some major Supreme Court rulings to make a "Clippy" for Fucker Forms.

v1.1 Changelog
1) Created a "Fucker-Boy 3000" interface and began working on implementation of session sharing on backend. 

v1.0 Changelog (Note: Site may be in active development while you're using it, if you run into errors please let me know).

1) Upload spreadsheets. They can be either CSV or XLSX with a 2MB upload limit until this can better handle large documents. 
2) You can search/filter by specific fields. Most often you'll want to search by what's in the "description field".
3) Multi-word search has been enabled. You can now search for things like, "Salary LastName" or "LastName Salary" and it should filter down to the same level of results. 
4) You can sort the sheet by amount, either ascending or descending, to quickly figure out where spending is happening the most. 
5) You can manually mark rows by a specific color. 
6) Calculating what's in the "contributed" field will automatically assign a color based on the difference between was was brought in vs. how much was taken out. For instance, if someone took out a $20,000 paycheck but only contributed $450 into the budget, it will automatically mark this row as "red". 
7) Once you're done, you can "Export Your Work" to a new Excel spreadsheet that has your work filtered down to the view you're working on. 
8) If you don't want to lose your work but need to come back to it later, "Save Session (Local)" will store your work in just your browser so that you can close the window and come back to it and not lose your work.
9) There's different "themes" to choose from, including Fucker95, the outdated operating system used by law enforcement in the Los Santos area.
